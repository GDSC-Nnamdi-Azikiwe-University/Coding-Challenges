# Coding Challenges

This repository contains some of the questions I practiced during mt placement and interview preparation. I will constantly keep updating this repository as I keep practicing.

## Repo structure

I have segregated the questions by the coding platform (LeetCode, Hackerrank etc.). Each folder contains the solutions files labelled serially, and a respective readme in every folder, with links to the respective question. 

I highly suggest that you first practice solving the questions on your own, and after implementing a solution, you can take a look at mine
